# Google-doodle

The project demonstrates the simulation of a google doodle.we have tried to create a
google doodle for christmas theme.Here we have first displayed google home page where each
letter of the word “GOOGLE” ,when pressed enter, turn into various christmas themed objects
say snowflakes,bell,christmas tree,snowman and gift box respectively.
We have also added music to it such that all the words will keep on dancing till the
music stops.

All the required library files and the header files are available in the included directory. The library files are GL, GLU, glut,thread etc.
